## üß™ Testing

### Before Submitting

1. **Test your changes** thoroughly
2. **Run the CI checks** locally:
   ```bash
   # Check Python code style
   flake8 .
   black --check .
   isort --check-only .
   
   # Check script syntax
   bash -n 11-scripts/*.sh
   bash -n 09-docker-setup/*.sh
   ```
3. **Test Docker setup** if you modified it:
   ```bash
   cd 09-docker-setup
   docker-compose config
   ```
4. **Verify documentation** links and formatting

### Testing Guidelines

- Test on clean environments when possible
- Verify examples work as described
